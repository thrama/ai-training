# Question

Let's suppose you have a social media account on Instagram, Twitter, or some other platform (just in case you don't, it doesn't matter. We'll fill you in with the relevant information). You check your account and notice that you have a new follower – this means that another user has decided to start following you to see things that you post. You don't recognize the person, and their username (or "handle" as it's called) is a little strange: John37330190. You don't want to have creepy bots following you, so you wonder whether to block them. To decide whether you should block the new follower, you decide to use the Bayes rule!

Let's assume that 5% of your new followers are bots: this can be written as
```
P(bot) = 0.05
```

Let's also assume that 80% of bot accounts have a username that includes an 8-digit number (like 37330190):
```
P(8-digits | bot) = 0.8
```

The last term that is required is the probability, P(8-digits), which is the probability that a new follower (either a bot or not) has an 8-digit number in their username. This probability would be quite hard to know or estimate directly. Instead, we may just know that real people who follow you usually don't have such a sequence in their username, so perhaps we have:
```
P(8-digits | human) = 0.01.
```

The nice thing is that we can now calculate P(8-digits) from the above information. The formula may look a little nasty at first sight, unless you're familiar with probability calculus, but it's quite friendly if you approach it with a smile:
```
P(8-digits) = P(8-digits | bot) x P(bot) + P(8-digits | human) x P(human)
```

The last term P(human) must be 0.95 since the other option (bot) has probability 0.05.

# Answer
I'll help you solve this probability problem using Bayes' rule. Let's break it down step by step.

1. First, let's calculate P(8-digits) using the given formula:
   ```
   P(8-digits) = P(8-digits | bot) × P(bot) + P(8-digits | human) × P(human)
   P(8-digits) = 0.8 × 0.05 + 0.01 × 0.95
   P(8-digits) = 0.04 + 0.0095
   P(8-digits) = 0.0495
   ```

2. Now we can use Bayes' rule to find P(bot | 8-digits), which is what we really want to know - the probability that a follower is a bot given that they have an 8-digit number in their username:
   ```
   P(bot | 8-digits) = P(8-digits | bot) × P(bot) / P(8-digits)
   P(bot | 8-digits) = 0.8 × 0.05 / 0.0495
   P(bot | 8-digits) = 0.04 / 0.0495
   P(bot | 8-digits) ≈ 0.808
   ```

This means that given the username contains an 8-digit number, there's about an 80.8% chance that the account is a bot. This is quite a high probability! Based on this analysis, it would be reasonable to block this follower since there's a strong indication that it's a bot account.

Interesting, isn't it? Bayes' rule has transformed our initial assumption of 5% bots among followers into a much higher probability of 80.8% when we account for the specific evidence of the 8-digit number in the username.
